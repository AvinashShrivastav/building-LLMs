In a small coastal town, there lived a fisherman named Ravi. Each morning, he set out before sunrise, guided by the stars and the sound of the waves. Life was not easy, but Ravi found joy in the simple things—the laughter of children, the warmth of the sun, and the stories he shared with fellow villagers. His nets were often light, yet he carried no complaints, for he believed that gratitude was a stronger anchor than wealth.

One day, while fishing, Ravi caught a glimmering golden fish. To his surprise, it spoke: “Set me free, and I shall grant you a wish.” Ravi thought for a moment and said, “I wish for my village to always have enough food.” The fish smiled, promised abundance, and disappeared into the sea. Ravi returned home with an empty basket, but his heart was full of hope.

From that day on, the village flourished. The fields produced bountiful harvests, the sea was generous with its catch, and no family went to bed hungry. Ravi became known as the man whose kindness changed the fate of the village. Strangers who visited often asked him why he had not wished for riches, a grand house, or fame. He would simply smile and reply, “What good is gold if your neighbors are starving?”

As the years passed, Ravi grew old, but his story lived on. The children of the village would gather around him, listening eagerly as he recounted the tale of the golden fish and the wish that brought prosperity to all. When he could no longer sail, the villagers cared for him with the same kindness he had shown them. 

Ravi never left behind treasures of silver or gold, but something far greater—an everlasting reminder that true wealth lies in compassion, gratitude, and the joy of giving.
